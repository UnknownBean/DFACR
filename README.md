A clothing randomizer written in Java/JavaFX

*How To Use*
Take pictures of clothes and drop them into the appropriate locations within the "ClothingItems" directory
-All files must be saved in the PNG or JPG format for java to be able to access them

*Notes*
It's kinda trash right now, but as I work on learning how to design UI, I hope it improves.
